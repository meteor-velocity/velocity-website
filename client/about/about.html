# About Velocity

Velocity came out of a joint online meeting focused on testing featuring Sam Hatoum, Arunoda Susiripala, Adrian Lanning, Michael Risse, Ry Walker, and Josh Owens. The meetup went extremely well, you can actually watch it on youtube. At the end of the meetup we started talking about how to work together making Meteor testing awesome. The host, Robert Dickert, decided he would be the organizer of our group and we started meeting weekly with the goal of building something to make testing easier. What followed was an amazing experience of people working together to make the testing landscape 100% different than what exists before this meetup happened.
