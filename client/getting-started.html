# Getting Started

## Why Test?

Have you ever reached the point on an app where you were afraid to change something? As a project gets bigger, it gets more difficult to think through the code paths and how they interact. The same is true as a project ages and you either forget some decisions or find that others have changed the code. You can't predict what side-effects a code change may produce, and this can lead to paralysis.  On the other hand, have you found that something that used to work is broken and have no idea how or when it broke? Checking the bug across various git commits works but is time-consuming.

Setting up a testing harness protects against these problems. You can change your code with impunity because you will know right away if you break something elsewhere in your app. Then you can deal with the problem while you still have all of your code "in your head."

This guide will get you started started with Velocity in a few minutes. We recommend using Velocity with Meteor 1.0 or higher.

If you are relatively new to testing or just want to keep things simple, we recommend beginning with an integration testing framework. **Integration testing** gives you access to the full application environment in a mirror application. The mirror can run without affecting your main  app, so it will not interfere with manual tests, demos, or anything else you need to do with your app while you develop. Because the full environment is available, you can use all packages and Meteor API methods that you are used to, making this kind of testing quite intuitive. These tests are also fast enough to give you real-time feedback. Every time you save your code, all your tests will be re-run, and you will know whether your tests passed. This provides ideal conditions for [test-driven development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).

### See an example
You can see a working example of the Meteor Leaderboard example app with working tests by downloading the [velocity demo](https://github.com/meteor-velocity/velocity-examples).

There are multiple example implementations included in the velocity-examples repo.

```bash
# clone the velocity-examples repo and run meteor
$ git clone https://github.com/meteor-velocity/velocity-examples.git
$ cd velocity-examples/leaderboard-cucumber
$ meteor
```


## Test Frameworks

Velocity currently has two packages, Mocha and Jasmine, that implement integration testing in the client, and you can choose based on features or the syntax that you prefer. We currently do not recommend installing both Jasmine and Mocha at the same time.

### Mocha
The [Mocha package](https://atmospherejs.com/mike/mocha) allows you to test with [Mocha](http://mochajs.org) syntax. It gives you integration testing on both the client and server.

Mocha can be added from within your app's directory with

    meteor add mike:mocha

Start your app, and you will see a green dot in the upper-righthand corner of your app. If you click on it, it will expand to show the HTML reporter. There aren't currently any tests, and it will show you 0 of 0 passing. You will need to add them to your app's `tests/` directory. The easiest way to do this is to click the button marked 'Add mocha sample tests'. If you do this, you will see the app update, and in a few seconds you will have a couple of passing tests shown. You can check your app's `tests/` directory to see the structure of the test files (a `tests/` directory will be added if necessary). Mocha looks for tests in the `tests/mocha/` directory, and in this directory, `client` and `server` tests are placed into directories of the same name. For further information, see the [package readme](https://github.com/mad-eye/meteor-mocha-web/) and the core (non-Meteor-specific)  [Mocha webpage](http://mochajs.org)


### Jasmine
The [Jasmine package](https://atmospherejs.com/?q=jasmine) allows you to test with [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html) syntax. It gives you integration testing on the client and unit testing on the server.

Jasmine can be added from within your app's directory with

    meteor add sanjo:jasmine
    meteor add velocity:html-reporter

Start your app, and you will see a green dot in the upper-righthand corner of your app. If you click on it, it will expand to show the HTML reporter. There aren't currently any tests, and it will show you 0 of 0 passing. You will need to add them to your app's `tests/` directory. The Jasmine package installs as two frameworks, an integration testing framework for the client, and a unit testing framework for the server.

To add either client or server sample tests, you can click the appropriate blue button on the right. If you do this, you will see the app update, and in a few seconds you will have a couple of passing tests shown. You can check your app's `tests/` directory to see the structure of the test files (a `tests/` directory will be added if necessary). Jasmine looks for tests in the `tests/jasmine/` directory, and it further segregates between `client` and `server` folders. Inside those, `integration` and `unit` folders separate types of tests, although currently only unit tests are available on the server, and only integration tests are available on the client. For further information, see the [package readme](https://github.com/Sanjo/meteor-jasmine/) and the main (non-Meteor-specific) [Jasmine webpage](http://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html)

### Nightwatch
The [Nightwatch Framework](https://github.com/meteor-velocity/nightwatch-framework) allows you to run automated browser acceptance test with [Nightwatch.js](http://nightwatchjs.org/), a Javascript bridge to the industry standard [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) server.  It gives you a way to simulate user interactions (and therefore business requirements) by automating the browser itself.

Nightwatch can be added from within your app's directory with

    meteor add velocity:nightwatch-framework
    meteor add velocity:html-reporter

Nightwatch tests are a bit different than Mocha and Jasmine tests, in that they are _acceptance_ tests, rather than _unit_ or _integration_ tests.  They are also much more expensive to run, since an entire separate web browser has to be launched.  They are slower to run, as well, since they simulate the actions that an actual user would make.  As such, we don't run Nightwatch acceptance tests automatically each time a file is saved.  Rather, we want to run acceptance tests when we upload a commit to GitHub or generate a pull-request.  It's recommended that you open a terminal and watch the tests run from there, as there will be a significant delay between when you click the 'Run Nightwatch Tests' button and when the tests show up in the reporter.  


### Cucumber
The [Cucumber package](https://atmospherejs.com/xolvio/cucumber) allows you to test your application by writing acceptance tests in the Gherkin syntax. Cucumber tests automate your web browser so you are testing your application exactly as a user would.

Cucumber can be added from within your app's directory with:

    $ meteor add xolvio:cucumber


Here are some further resources on testing Meteor applications with Cucumber:

* [velocity-examples cucumber example](https://github.com/meteor-velocity/velocity-examples/tree/master/leaderboard-cucumber)
* [Letterpress example](https://github.com/xolvio/Letterpress)


### RobotFramework
The [Robot Framework](https://atmospherejs.com/rsbatech/robotframework) package allows you to automatically run end-to-end acceptance tests against your Meteor application with the Python-based [Robot Framework](http://robotframework.org), and report test results to Velocity - suported test reporters as well as Robot Framework's own HTML - based reports.

Robot Framework tests are keyword - driven text or HTML files, supporting different scripting styles including Gherkin Given / When / Then syntax.  Using Robot Framework also gives you immediate access to many [built-in](http://robotframework.org/#libraries-standard) and [3rd party](http://robotframework.org/#libraries-external) test libraries for extending test coverage to other technologies, databases, remote systems etc.  This makes Robot Framework a great choice if your Meteor application is part of a wider infrastructure.

Before using this Meteor package, you must install Python, Robot Framework and the [Selenium2Library](https://github.com/rtomac/robotframework-selenium2library) test library yourself on your target system ... follow the full [installation instructions here](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/blob/master/INSTALL.rst). If you already have Python 2.5, 2.6 or 2.7 available and the Pip installer, then simply execute:

    $ sudo pip install robotframework-selenium2library

Then install the Robot Framework Meteor package:

    $ meteor add rsbatech:robotframework

This package will also install copies of the PhantomJs and ChromeDriver NPM packages ready for use with the Selenium2Library Robot Framework library that you have pre-installed.

Here are some further resources on testing Meteor applications with Robot Framework:

## Reporters

### HTML Reporter

The [HTML reporter](http://github.com/meteor-velocity/html-reporter) is a small smart package that displays the results of your tests in an overlay inside your app. It is added by default in some frameworks such as Mocha, but can be added explicitly with `meteor add velocity:html-reporter`. It will display the test results of all installed Velocity test frameworks, updating reactively in response to changing test results. Integration and unit tests will typically be rerun every time the code is saved, giving you realtime feedback on whether your code is passing tests.

The HTML reporter's overlay can be shown by clicking on the dot that Velocity places in the upper-righthand corner of your app. If you click on the dot again, the reporter will be hidden, and you can interact with your app normally. If a test fails, the dot will change its appearance, so you will be alerted immediately if your testing status changes from all tests passing to having errors, even if the overlay is hidden. There are some options you can select from a pane in the reporter, such as whether passing tests are shown. These options are saved using the Amplify package so that your options will persist even if you have to refresh the page or test in a new tab. Like all of Velocity, the HTML reporter is flagged as `debugOnly` to Meteor, so it will not be bundled in production builds.


## What other tests can I run?
While we advocate that most developers start with integration testing, there are other types of tests that may be more suitable for your situation.

**Unit tests** run without the full environment, isolating code units such as functions and objects for testing. This requires you to mock any outside objects needed by the unit currently being tested. For example, your code may call `Tracker.autorun()`, but the `Tracker` symbol will not be defined in a unit test - you must provide your own (possibly no-op) version of `Tracker.autorun()` for the test or your code will throw an error. Velocity provides most of your mocking automatically, but you will still need to do some of your own to make the tests work. In return for this investment, you get much faster tests. This is by far the fastest form of testing, perhaps by an order of magnitude. It also encourages you to write modular, decoupled code. The [Jasmine framework](https://atmospherejs.com/?q=jasmine) currently supports unit testing on the server.

**End-to-end tests** (also called **UI tests**) simulate manual testing by performing clicks, data entry, and other tasks that a user would perform and then verifying that the interface of the app responds correctly, for example checking that a certain `<div>` contains the expected text. They have the advantage of confirming that the entire process is working as a whole, whereas other tests may miss problems caused by the interactions between components. End-to-end tests are also very intuitive to write. However, these tests can be more brittle (one ID change in a template may break multiple tests) and also may not tell you *where* an error occurred. They also tend to run slowly enough that it is impractical to run them every time you save your code. [Selenium Webdriver](http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/) is the tool most used for end-to-end testing, and is used by both the [Nightwatch](/getting-started#nightwatch) and [Cucumber](/getting-started#cucumber) test frameworks.

There are other kinds of testing, such as performance tests, smoke tests, and metrics such as code coverage. We will be adding resources that help you learn about your options as the Velocity project develops.  [Pull requests](https://github.com/meteor-velocity/website) are encouraged!

## Why are there so many kinds of tests?
Developers new to testing may find the number of choices overwhelming. Let's try to put them in context. Testing at different levels solves different problems. You may be tempted just to do end-to-end tests, because they are easy to understand, but if an end-to-end test fails, how do you know where the failure occurred? Often one test may touch several different parts of your app. In addition, consider code paths. Each `if` statement, for example, creates two code paths, one for `true`, and one for `false`. The number of tests you could do based on code paths is nearly infinite for some end-to-end tests, whereas unit tests can test all code paths fairly easily if your functions are small. And because unit testing covers small code units, it is likely to tell you with far greater precision where a problem occurred. Integration test covers a middle ground for checking how groups of units work together. Because of this, testing is [often depicted as a pyramid](http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/the-forgotten-layer-of-the-test-automation-pyramid) where the width of the pyramid indicates how many tests you have.

Unlike most web frameworks, Meteor works on both the client and server. This means that you can have both client and server testing under one umbrella. [The 7 Testing Modes of Meteor](http://www.meteortesting.com/blog/e72fe/the-7-testing-modes-of-meteor) by Sam Hatoum can help you understand some of these variations.
