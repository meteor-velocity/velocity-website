      <h3>What exacly is velocity?</h3>
      Velocity is both a community and a framework. It is a framework that allows
      common testing components to be shared across different testing frameworks.
      For example mocha, jasmine, and cucumber all use the same reporter (the reporter
      is responsible for telling the user what tests passed and failed). It is
      a community that regularly meets to make testing in Meteor the best it
      can be.
      <h3>What kind of testing can I do with Velocity?</h3>
      Different frameworks support different kinds of testing. For more info look
      at each tab on the Getting Started page.
      <h3>Where can I learn more?</h3>

      <h3>How did Velocity get started?</h3>
      Velocity came out of a joint online meeting focused on testing featuring
      Sam Hatoum, Arunoda Susiripala, Adrian Lanning, Michael Risse, Ry Walker,
      and Josh Owens. The meetup went extremely well, you can actually watch it
      on youtube. At the end of the meetup we started talking about how to work
      together making Meteor testing awesome. The host, Robert Dickert, decided
      he would be the organizer of our group and we started meeting weekly with
      the goal of building something to make testing easier. What followed was
      an amazing experience of people working together to make the testing
      landscape 100% different than what exists before this meetup happened.

      <h3>How do I disable velocity?</h3>
